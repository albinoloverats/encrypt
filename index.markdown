encrypt is a small application which has been designed, from the beginning
(all three of them so far), to be as simple to use as is practical. The
idea is small and simple, yet with encryption that aims to be a strong as
possible, while also giving the user the choice about how their data is
secured.

It is mostly written in C, and uses the [GTK][] for the GUI (version 3.0
or later), to help increase the portability and usefulness across many different
operating systems. All of the cryptographic functions are provided by
[libgcrypt][]; this increases the number of available algorithms for the
end user, and also ensures that the implementations are correct and (largely)
free of (serious) bugs :-)

Not only do we have an Android version, but we also now have a native release
for Mac OS X! (Of course if you would prefer, you can still build an X11
version using Homebrew and following the typical *nix instructions in the
documentation.)

Currently we provide 64 bit binary packages&mdash;with GUI&mdash;for Arch,
Debian, Fedora, Slackware, FreeBSD, Apple's OS X, as well as now Microsoft
Windows. The DEB package is also compatible with the latest version of Ubuntu,
and the RPM is _(mostly)_ compatible with SUSE (it might complain that it
cannot satisfy the curl dependency but this can be ignored, you just won't
be prompted when a new version of encrypt is available). The Windows package
(whilst built an tested on Windows 7 should also work on later versions).

It's this level of portability and simplicity which we hope will make encrypt
more useful to people who use different operating systems in different
situations: home, office, on the go, etc. as it uses the same algorithms
and interface. <span style="color:#dc143c;">Be aware that the Whirlpool
algorithm is different on desktops versus Android.</span>

NB: It has been noted that some characters, when used in the password, aren't
completely cross-platform; for instance the character Â£ doesn't play well
on Android devices.

Binary packages, and GPG signatures, for version 2017.09 are available below:
