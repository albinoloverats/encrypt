encrypt - 200901                                  January 1st, 2009

Finally, a new release! Mostly minor changes to the code to remove
some memory leaks and miscellaneous small bugs. On top of that, the
entied module structure has been rewritten, so it now makes more
sense (there are 1 or 2 changes in the main body of encrypt to
accomodate for this).

This is also the first release which sees binary packages not only
for MS Windows, but also for Debian and Fedora. The code has also
been moved accross to machines running FreeeBSD and OpenSolaris; so
far so good, but the GUI will take a little more work.

Build/Installation notes:

  On GNU/*Nix Systems:
    Simplly:
      $ make all
      # make install-all

    To build specific parts (modules or the GUI) use:
      $ make gui
      $ make %s

    You should be able to 'cut-and-paste' the different build
    options to compile and install exactly what you need (and
    nothing else):
      $ make gui helloworld

    Eventually you may need the following (distclean will clean
    modules too):
      $ make clean
      $ make distclean
      # make uninstall

  On MS Systems:
    It's all done for you (Using Dev-C++) - if you wish to compile
    from source yourself, this shouldn't be too much of a problem
    suing Dev-C++ (just ask if you need help). The NSIS scipt will
    then allow you to build the installer (or you can just copy the
    binaries to wherever and go from there).

Note: You will need to have installed both the GTK development and
runtime libraries to use the GUI. They should be easily available
in you distro's package manager, or if you're on MS Windows:
http://gtk-win.sourceforge.net/home/index.php/en/Home
