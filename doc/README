encrypt - version TBA                                   August 7th, 2008

The next version will likely consist of a cleaner code base, as
well as any bug fixes that are required. The code is SVN should be
mostly up-to-date and compile on any GNU/Linux with recent versions
of common libraries.

There is also the aim of getting the installers for all of the
plugins working on Windows systems.

Build/Installation notes:

  On GNU Systems:
    Simplly:
        % make all
        $ make install-all

    To build specific parts (modules or the GUI) use:
        % make gui
        % make %s

    You should be able to 'cut-and-paste' the different build
    options to compile and install exactly what you need (and
    nothing else):
        % make gui helloworld

    Eventually you may need the following:
        % make clean
        % make distclean
        $ make uninstall

  On MS Systems:
    It's all done for you (Using Dev-C++) - if you wish to compile
    from source yourself, this shouldn't be too much of a problem
    suing Dev-C++ (just ask if you need help). The NSIS scipt will
    then allow you to build the installer (or you can just copy the
    binaries to wherever and go from there).

Note:  You will need to have installed the GTK Run Time Libraries:
for the GUI, both *NIX and Windows, which you can get from your
distro's package manager, or if you're on Windows:
