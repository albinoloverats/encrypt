Description: <inseA simple, X-platform, plugin-based encryption application
 encrypt is a simple encryption application which is suitable for any 
 modern OS. It uses the GTK to provide a graphical user interface, yet
 is equally usable from the command line. Plugins allow additional 
 algorithms to be chosen by the user at runtime.
