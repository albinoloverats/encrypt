    it appears to have been fixed)

* Android
  - Fix permission handling
  - Attempt to fix NullPointerException after exit (think we've got it;
    it is rather intermittent)


encrypt - 2015.10                                           4th Oct 2015
-----------------

### New For Latest Release

* Automatic error correction of encrypted container format

### Fixed For Latest Release

* UNIX
  - Infinite loop on decryption attempt of unrecognised version
* Android
  - Fix compatibility menu bug
  - Change Android tray icon to black & white

  - Workaround for the AES/Rijndael issue; instead of using the DLL from
    http://lrn.no-ip.info we now use the DLL included as part of the
    Gpg4win project


encrypt - 2015.01                                           4th Jan 2015
-----------------

### New For This Release

* No header information
  - If you don’t keep the header, you MUST remember which algorithms and
    mode you used to encrypt the data!
  - This feature is so that if you choose to encrypt your data and then
    hide it in an image (steganography) if you’re coerced to extract it
    will still looks like random pixel data
  - Will keep going even if decryption cannot be verified (until an out
    of memory error - or similar - occurs!)
* Random IV’s (not derived from key)
* Build Slackware package for easy installation
* On Android, display notification of progress
* Store filename even when encrypting a single file

### Fixed For This Release

* Figure out why the Android app doesn’t like Windows encrypted files
  - It wasn’t actually due to Windows, but a subtle bug in the Android
    code
* Fix bug caused by no rc file
* Plugged some memory leaks
* Better support for en/decrypting from/to a directory


encrypt - 2014.06                                         20th July 2014
-----------------

There’s been a lot of (small) changes for this release. Perhaps the most
significant update is the ability to select the cipher mode (the default
was CBC). The most obvious update to the Windows build is the GUI is now
GTK+3 instead of GTK+2, the other major change for Windows is the use of
the latest version of libgcrypt (now inline with GNU/Linux and OS X).

Speaking of OS X, I think that the libgcrypt issue there has been fixed.
(encrypt still works if I remove libgcrypt from Homebrew - if you are an
OS X user please let us know.)

Next is Android: there were a few bugs that were found and have been now
squashed. Specifically the keyboard would disappear when a user tried to
enter a number in the password field. encrypt on Android, has too had an
update to the version of the gnu-crypto library it depends on.  This was
prompted by the way that the CTR mode was broken, and didn’t allow an IV
to be set (and version 2.1.0 does).

Lastly, there were numerous memory leaks plugged, and greater/better use
of the rc file: changing the selected algorithms/mode will be remembered
for the next use (settings take effect immediately).  Windows has better
Explorer integration, and there has been work towards a similar level of
integration on GNU/Linux (but it’s still a work in progress).


encrypt - 2013.11.01                                       25th Jan 2014
--------------------

Update/Fix for libgcrypt version 1.6


encrypt - 2013.11                                          24th Nov 2013
-----------------

A significant bug in regards to the encryption of directories on Windows
has been fixed with the help of Mark Condic, so much thanks there!

There has also been several significant changes on all platforms such as
the more traditional (or expected) approach to file links:  on Unix-like
systems the links themselves are stored by default (unlike before, where
the files the links pointed to were stored); and on Windows and Android,
obviously they don’t have links to encrypt,  but during decryption links
are handled in one of two ways: symbolic links are ignored, whereas hard
links cause the file to be copied. Although this means the file is dupl-
icated it’s the closest approximation to the original as possible.

The second major addition to encrypt’s abilities is the option to create
encrypted archives for previous versions of the application. NB This has
had only limited testing and should’t be relied upon!  You should really
be using the latest version wherever possible! (But it’s there for those
who might find it useful from time-to-time.)


encrypt - 2013.02                                           7th Feb 2013
-----------------

Hot off the heals of our last release we’re here with another. It brings
the much needed and hugely requested new feature: encrypted directories.
You can now select and encrypt directories in addition to files. The has
resulted in an update to the user interface to show the current progress
and overall progress of the encryption/decryption.

The other significant update is for Android version: key file support is
now available. Use the menu to toggle between entering a password or se-
lecting a file to for key generation.

There has also been a couple of changes to the internal structure of the
encrypted files; though as always, the latest version is able to decrypt
your previously encrypted data.

The native OS X port is now here too! So that’s now GNU/Linux, Microsoft
Windows, Android and of course Apple’s OS X!


encrypt - 2012.11                                          19th Nov 2012
-----------------

A little over a year since the previous release but we’re back with many
significant changes:  first and foremost is the capability to compress a
file (or data stream) before it is encrypted.  Before you ask, yes we’re
intending to support encrypting multiple files in an upcoming (maybe the
next) version.

The other major improvement is the ability to set default algorithms for
both the key hashing and encryption itself.  On Unix-like systems create
the file ~/.encryptrc or copy the example from utils/_encryptrc.  If you
are running MS Windows,  the file is %Program Files%\encrypt\_encryptrc.

The UI of the desktop edition has also been simplified;  the output file
is selected as you would expect, instead of having to select a directory
and then type in the file name.  In addition, there is a new menu option
"Options". Currently the only option is to toggle compression on or off.


encrypt - 201110                                       16th October 2011
-----------------

We’re on some sort of a roll here; there’s a new release of encrypt.  It
fixes a couple of minor bugs---checksums are now correctly computed and,
therefore, correctly verified upon decryption---as well as introducing a
few new behind-the-scenes features:  the internal structure of encrypted
data is split into blocks, which will be necessary in the future,  as we
introduce data compression (planned for the next release). The other new
feature is the ability to notify the user if  a newer version of encrypt
is available for download.

That’s all for now, although we’ll be back soon with more updates,  such
as compression, and anything else that comes our way...


encrypt - 201108                                        21st August 2011
-----------------

It’s been  a little  while but here  we have  the  latest  offering  for
personal file security!

In an effort to make encrypt even more useful to even more people,  it’s
been rewritten to use a 3rd party encryption library---notably,  the GNU
Project’s libgcrypt and gnu-crypto.  This change increases the choice of
algorithms as well as providing a base for an Android counterpart to the
standard desktop package.  That’s right---we’ve an Android version which
is compatible with the desktop version.

The inspiration behind providing an  Android app came ( in part ) due to
some of the security  concerns which have been highlighted with services
such as Dropbox. Whilst online file hosting services are a great way for
transferring  files  from  desktop  to  laptop, and now to smartphone or
tablet,  their less-than-ideal encryption processes meant something more
was needed: encrypt for GNU/Linux, MS Windows and Android!
