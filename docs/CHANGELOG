We're on some sort of a roll here; there's a new release of encrypt.  It
fixes a couple of minor bugs---checksums are now correctly computed and,
therefore, correctly verified upon decryption---as well as introducing a
few new behind-the-scenes features:  the internal structure of encrypted
data is split into blocks, which will be necessary in the future,  as we
introduce data compression (planned for the next release). The other new
feature is the ability to notify the user if  a newer version of encrypt
is available for download.

That's all for now, although we'll be back soon with more updates,  such
as compression, and anything else that comes our way...

It's been  a little  while but here  we have  the  latest  offering  for
personal file security!

In an effort to make encrypt even more useful to even more people,  it's
been rewritten to use a 3rd party encryption library---notably,  the GNU
Project's libgcrypt and gnu-crypto.  This change increases the choice of
algorithms as well as providing a base for an Android counterpart to the
standard desktop package.  That's right---we've an Android version which
is compatible with the desktop version.

The inspiration behind providing an  Android app came ( in part ) due to
some of the security  concerns which have been highlighted with services
such as Dropbox. Whilst online file hosting services are a great way for
transferring  files  from  desktop  to  laptop, and now to smartphone or
tablet,  their less-than-ideal encryption processes meant something more
was needed: encrypt for GNU/Linux, MS Windows and Android!
