A history of what happened before, and a taste of what's to come…


Planned Future Enhancements
---------------------------

* Better desktop integration (context menu's and such like)
* Full (non-Homebrew) support on Apple's OS X
* Support for file links on Android  (although this is dependant on full
  Java NIO support)
* Bug fixes as necessary ;-)

-----------------

A significant bug in regards to the encryption of directories on Windows
has been fixed with the help of Mark Condic, so much thanks there!

There has also been several significant changes on all platforms such as
the more traditional (or expected) approach to file links:  on Unix-like
systems the links themselves are stored by default (unlike before, where
the files the links pointed to were stored); and on Windows and Android,
obviously they don't have links to encrypt,  but during decryption links
are handled in one of two ways: symbolic links are ignored, whereas hard
links cause the file to be copied. Although this means the file is dupl-
icated it's the closest approximation to the original as possible.

The second major addition to encrypt's abilities is the option to create
encrypted archives for previous versions of the application. NB This has
had only limited testing and should't be relied upon!  You should really
be using the latest version wherever possible! (But it's there for those
who might find it useful from time-to-time.)


encrypt - 2013.02                                           7th Feb 2013
-----------------

Hot off the heals of our last release we're here with another. It brings
the much needed and hugely requested new feature: encrypted directories.
You can now select and encrypt directories in addition to files. The has
resulted in an update to the user interface to show the current progress
and overall progress of the encryption/decryption.

The other significant update is for Android version: key file support is
now available. Use the menu to toggle between entering a password or se-
lecting a file to for key generation.

There has also been a couple of changes to the internal structure of the
encrypted files; though as always, the latest version is able to decrypt
your previously encrypted data.

The native OS X port is now here too! So that's now GNU/Linux, Microsoft
Windows, Android and of course Apple's OS X!


encrypt - 2012.11                                          19th Nov 2012
-----------------

A little over a year since the previous release but we're back with many
significant changes:  first and foremost is the capability to compress a
file (or data stream) before it is encrypted.  Before you ask, yes we're
intending to support encrypting multiple files in an upcoming (maybe the
next) version.

The other major improvement is the ability to set default algorithms for
both the key hashing and encryption itself.  On Unix-like systems create
the file ~/.encryptrc or copy the example from utils/_encryptrc.  If you
are running MS Windows,  the file is %Program Files%\encrypt\_encryptrc.

The UI of the desktop edition has also been simplified;  the output file
is selected as you would expect, instead of having to select a directory
and then type in the file name.  In addition, there is a new menu option
"Options". Currently the only option is to toggle compression on or off.


encrypt - 201110                                       16th October 2011
-----------------

We're on some sort of a roll here; there's a new release of encrypt.  It
fixes a couple of minor bugs---checksums are now correctly computed and,
therefore, correctly verified upon decryption---as well as introducing a
few new behind-the-scenes features:  the internal structure of encrypted
data is split into blocks, which will be necessary in the future,  as we
introduce data compression (planned for the next release). The other new
feature is the ability to notify the user if  a newer version of encrypt
is available for download.

That's all for now, although we'll be back soon with more updates,  such
as compression, and anything else that comes our way...


encrypt - 201108                                        21st August 2011
-----------------

It's been  a little  while but here  we have  the  latest  offering  for
personal file security!

In an effort to make encrypt even more useful to even more people,  it's
been rewritten to use a 3rd party encryption library---notably,  the GNU
Project's libgcrypt and gnu-crypto.  This change increases the choice of
algorithms as well as providing a base for an Android counterpart to the
standard desktop package.  That's right---we've an Android version which
is compatible with the desktop version.

The inspiration behind providing an  Android app came ( in part ) due to
some of the security  concerns which have been highlighted with services
such as Dropbox. Whilst online file hosting services are a great way for
transferring  files  from  desktop  to  laptop, and now to smartphone or
tablet,  their less-than-ideal encryption processes meant something more
was needed: encrypt for GNU/Linux, MS Windows and Android!
