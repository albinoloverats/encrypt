Compiling/Installing From Source
================================

Prerequisites
-------------

To compile from source on GNU/Linux you will need the following:
* GTK (version 3 or newer)
* libgcrypt
* liblzma
* libcurl
* pthreads

Most of the above are installed as part of the base (or core) OS on many
distributions (but not always).

The Process
-----------

NB There is no configure step, so just do the following:
* make
* make install

Or perhaps you don't want a GUI:
* make cli
* make install

Done :-)


For non-GNU/Linux
-----------------

* Microsoft Windows
  - It's a headache! We used Dev C++ as the frontend to gcc and God only
    knows how we managed to get GTK linked in, but we did! And so now we
    are not going to touch anything incase it breaks.
  - Dev C++ can be used to download all of the necessary packages (which
    includes GTK). encrypt.exe can then be compiled. Check the NSIS file
    (ncrypt.nsi) to see what binaries are necessary during installation.

* Mac OS X
  - Get Homebrew (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)
  - Install libgcrypt, xz and curl
  - Use Xcode to build a native OS X application: Encrypt.app

* Android
  - gnu-crypto.jar
  - xz-1.0.jar
  - Android File Dialog - http://code.google.com/p/android-file-dialog/
