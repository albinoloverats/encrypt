Compiling/Installing
====================

Binary Installation
-------------------

Use the binary package  and default package installation method for your
system:

* Arch
  - Pacman
* Debian
  - dpkg
* Fedora
  - yum
* Slackware
  - installpkg
* FreeBSD
  - Ports
* Solaris
  - pkg
* Windows
  - The executable installer
* OS X
  - The pkg installer
* Andoird
  - The Google Play Store


Compiling from Source
---------------------

### Prerequisites

To compile from source you will need the following:

* GTK (version 3 or newer)
* libgcrypt
* liblzma
* libcurl
* pthreads


### Linux / FreeBSD

Most of the above are installed as part of the base (or core) OS on many
distributions  (but not always).  On FreeBSD use Makefile.bsd instead of
Makefile. Also note that there is no configure step, so just do the fol-
lowing:

* make
* make install

### For non-GNU/Linux

* Microsoft Windows
  - Install MSYS2 (following their instructions)
  - Install (using MSYS2) all of the above dependencies
  - Use Makefile.win to build encrypt.exe
  - Use the same makefile to build the installer

* Mac OS X
  - Install Homebrew (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)
  - Install (using Homebrew) libgcrypt, xz and curl
  - Use Xcode to build a native OS X application: Encrypt.app
  - Copy Encrypt.app to Applications

* Android
  - gnu-crypto.jar
  - xz-1.0.jar
  - Android File Dialog - http://code.google.com/p/android-file-dialog/
