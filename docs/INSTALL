Compiling/Installing From Source
================================


Prerequisites
-------------

To compile from source on GNU/Linux you will need the following:
* GTK (version 3 or newer)
* libgcrypt
* liblzma
* libcurl
* pthreads

Most of the above are installed as part of the base (or core) OS on many
distributions (but not always).


The Process
-----------

NB - There is no configure step, so just do the following:
* make
* make install

Or perhaps you don't want a GUI:
* make cli
* make install

Done :-)


For non-GNU/Linux
-----------------

* Microsoft Windows
  - It's a headache! We used Dev C++ as the frontend to gcc and God only
    knows how we managed to get GTK linked in, but we did! And so now we
    are not going to touch anything in case it breaks.
  - Dev C++ can be used to download most of the necessary packages,
    however some have to come from other sources:
    - http://curl.haxx.se/download.html
    - https://www.sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/
    - http://tukaani.org/xz/
    - http://lrn.no-ip.info/packages/i686-w64-mingw/libgcrypt/
  - The libgcrypt-20.dll actually comes from the Gpg4win project as this
    fixes the AES issue (http://www.gpg4win.org/)

* Mac OS X
  - Get Homebrew (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)
  - Install libgcrypt, xz and curl
  - Use Xcode to build a native OS X application: Encrypt.app

* Android
  - gnu-crypto.jar
  - xz-1.0.jar
  - Android File Dialog - http://code.google.com/p/android-file-dialog/
