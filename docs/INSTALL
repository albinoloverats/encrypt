Build instructions

Prerequisites:
 * Desktop implementation:
   - GTK (and all of its requirements: GDK/Cairo/etc)---version 2.24 or
     later---version 3 is recommended (and available on most/some Linux
     and Mac OS X using Homebrew)
   - libgcrypt cryptographic library
   - pthread library
   - liblzma
   - libcurl

 * Android implementation: (all provided)
   - gnu-crypto.jar
   - xz-1.0.jar
   - Android File Dialog - http://code.google.com/p/android-file-dialog/


Build/Installation instructions:
  For most,  installing encrypt will pull in all the required libraries,
  either  through your systems  package management system,  or if you're
  on  MS Windows,  the  installer  includes all  the  necessary  runtime
  libraries.  If you  intend to  build from source  you will require the
  development packages too.

  On GNU/Linux Systems:
    Simply:
      $ make
      # make install

    To build with the CLI:
      $ make cli
      $ make install

    Eventually, you may need the following:
      $ make clean
      $ make distclean
      # make uninstall

  On MS Systems:
    It's all done for you  (Using Dev-C++)---if you wish to compile from
    source  yourself,  this shouldn't  be too  much  of a  problem using
    Dev-C++ (just ask if you need help). The NSIS script will then allow
    you to  build the installer  (or you can just  copy the  binaries to
    wherever and go from there).

  On Mac OS X:
    For now you'll need Homebrew: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/
    As well as GTK and all of its dependencies (a proper OS X port is in
    the works but will have to fit around the current GUI code; which is
    hardcoded to use GTK).  The build instructions are the same as those
    for GNU/Linux, although you'll have to use the Makefile.macosx.

  For Android:
    Import the Eclipse/Android project into  Eclipse and build using the
    standard Android development tools.
