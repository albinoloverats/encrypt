.SH NAME
encrypt \- A simple, cross platform, file encryption application
.SH SYNOPSIS
encrypt [\fI\-c\fR \fBalgorithm\fR] [\fI\-s\fR \fBalgorithm\fR] [\fI\-k\fR \fBkey\fR/\fI\-p\fR \fBpassword\fR] [\fBsource\fR] [\fBdestination\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBencrypt\fR is a simple, cross platform, file encryption application---suitable for any modern desktop or mobile operating system. The GUI, either GTK or native, has been desigen to be common across systems and intuitive to use, whilst still providing command-line capabilities for power-users.

.PP
If either the source file or destination file are omitted then stdin/stdout are used. When encrypting, both \fB\-s\fR and \fB\-c\fR are required\fI*\fR to specify the algorithms you wish to use; when decrypting the algorithms originally used are read from the encrypted file.
.PP
\fI* You can omit the algorithm options if you have configured defaults in ~/.encryptrc\fR
.PP
If you do not specify either a key or a password, you will be prompted to enter a password. This will then be used to generate a key to encrypt the data with (using the specified hash).
.PP
You can toggle compression and how symbolic links are handled in the configuration file ~/.encryptrc

Note on spelling: As albinoloverats.net is a British company and "licence" is the correct spelling in its native language. However, the name of the licences, written in most cases in America, feature the American spelling of the word, license. As part of the title of the official licensing document it was thought inappropriate to alter the spelling. In British English, license is the verb, licence is the noun and licensee is the person who is granted a Licence.
