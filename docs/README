=================


About
-----

encrypt is a simple, cross platform, file encryption application. It is
suitable for any modern desktop or mobile operating system. The GUI,
either GTK or native, has been designed to be common across systems and
intuitive to use, while still providing command-line capabilities for
power-users.

It is currently available as a binary package for several GNU/Linux
distributions: Arch, Debian, Fedora, Slackware; as well as Apple’s OS X,
Microsoft Windows, and Android. It has also been tested on FreeBSD.

It supports a wide range of algorithms (provided by GNU’s libcrypt or
gnu-crypto), of which many are common between the two libraries and thus
allow encrypted files to be shared between systems. (Check that your
target system does support your intended cipher, as support will vary
depending on the library available.)
