About
-----

encrypt is a simple, cross platform, file encryption application. It is
suitable for any modern desktop or mobile operating system. The GUI,
either GTK or native, has been designed to be common across systems and
intuitive to use, while still providing command-line capabilities for
power-users.

It is currently available as a binary package for several GNU/Linux
distributions: Arch, Debian, Fedora, Slackware; as well as Apple’s OS X,
Microsoft Windows, and Android. It has also been tested on FreeBSD.

It supports a wide range of algorithms (provided by GNU’s libcrypt or
gnu-crypto), of which many are common between the two libraries and thus
allow encrypted files to be shared between systems. (Check that your
target system does support your intended cipher, as support will vary
depending on the library available at runtime!)

Compiling
---------

Compiling from source is as simple as running one of the following
commands:

    make
    make gui

- depending on what sort of interface you want (OS X, Windows, Android --
you don’t readlly get a choice).

Changelog
---------

### New For Latest Release

* Automatic error correction of encrypted container format

### Fixed For Latest Release

* UNIX
  - Infinite loop on decryption attempt of unrecognised version
* Android
  - Fix compatibility menu bug

TODO
----

### Add

* Find a way to merge file/magic info into main magic.mgc file
* File context menu for
  - Thunar (consider plugin)
  - Nautilus (or Files or whatever it’s called now)
  - Konqueror or Dolphin (maybe - it’s Qt based not GTK)

### Fix

* Fix SIGSEGV if the source file is deleted (even while doing nothing)
  (GTK file selection dialog - GNU/Linux)
* On Windows 8: AES is unavailable as there is a bug in libgcrypt. As
  and when this issue is fixed upstream, we’ll provide a fix too. This
  does not affect Windows 7. (Check if 1.6.3 fixes this issue.)
