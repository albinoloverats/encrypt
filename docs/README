### New For Next Release

* No header information
  - If you don't keep the header, you MUST remember which algorithms and
    mode you used to encrypt the data!
  - This feature is so that if you choose to encrypt your data and then
    hide it in an image (steganography) if you're coerced to extract it
    will still looks like random pixel data
  - Will keep going even if decryption cannot be verified (or until an
    out of memory error - or similar - occurs!)
* Random IV's (not derived from key) (we could also add a salt to the
  password for key generation)

### Fixed For Next Release

* Figure out why the Android app doesn't like Windows encrypted files
  - It wasn't actually due to Windows, but a subtle bug in the Android
    code
* Fix bug caused by no rc file

TODO
----

### From Previous Release

* Fix SIGSEGV if the source file is deleted (even while doing nothing)
* Find a way to merge file/magic info into main magic.mgc file
* File context menu for
  - Thunar (consider plugin)
  - Nautilus (or Files or whatever it's called now)
  - Konqueror or Dolphin (maybe - KDE is Qt, not GTK)

### Add For This Release

* Support no header
  - In GUI (halfway there, just need to add necessary buttons)
  - In Android (it's mostly plumbed in; a few GUI updates to go)
* On Android, allow backgrounding and then notify when complete
* More iterations for key/IV?

### Fix For This Release

* Figure out why occasionally the Windows build crashes - confirmed as
  both an algorithm and Windows 8 issue - attempting to use AES/Rijndael
  causes a major crash - cannot reproduce on Win7 (could be libgcrypt
  version or even 32/64-bit related)
