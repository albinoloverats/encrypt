encrypt - 2012.11                                          19th Nov 2012
=================

A little over a year since the previous release but we're back with many
significant changes:  first and foremost is the capability to compress a
file (or data stream) before it is encrypted.  Before you ask, yes we're
intending to support encrypting multiple files in an upcoming (maybe the
next) version.

The other major improvement is the ability to set default algorithms for
both the key hashing and encryption itself.  On Unix-like systems create
the file ~/.encryptrc or copy the example from utils/_encryptrc.  If you
are running MS Windows,  the file is %Program Files%\encrypt\_encryptrc.

The UI of the desktop edition has also been simplified;  the output file
is selected as you would expect, instead of having to select a directory
and then type in the file name.  In addition, there is a new menu option
"Options". Currently the only option is to toggle compression on or off.

Finally, looking to the future again, we've started working on a port of
encrypt to Apple's OS X (native obviously).  However, it is dependent on
Homebrew to provide libgcrypt, xzm and curl; once we've figured this out
we will provide an easy way to install here too. See INSTALL for details
on how to do this yourself.
