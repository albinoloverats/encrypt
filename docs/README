=================

New For Next Release
--------------------

* No header information
  - If you don't keep the header, you MUST remember which algorithms and
    mode you used to encrypt the data!
  - This feature is so that if you choose to encrypt your data and then
    hide it in an image (steganography) if you're coerced to extract it
    will still looks like random pixel data
  - Will keep going even if decryption cannot be verified (or until an
    out of memory error occurs!)
* Random IV's (not derived from key) (we could also add a salt to the
  password for key generation)

Fixed For Next Release
----------------------

* Figure out why the Android app doesn't like Windows encrypted files
  - It wasn't actually due to Windows, but a subtle bug in the Android
    code

From Previous Release
---------------------

* Fix SIGSEGV if the source file is deleted (even while doing nothing)
* Find a way to merge file/magic info into main magic.mgc file
* File context menu for
  - Thunar (consider plugin)
  - Nautilus (or Files or whatever it's called now)
  - Konqueror or Dolphin (maybe - KDE is Qt, not GTK)

Add For This Release
--------------------

* Support no header in GUI
* More iterations for key/IV?

Fix For This Release
--------------------

* Figure out why occasionally the Windows build crashes (seems algorithm
  or possibly Windows 8 related)
