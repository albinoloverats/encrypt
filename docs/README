### New For Next Release

* No header information
  - If you don’t keep the header, you MUST remember which algorithms and
    mode you used to encrypt the data!
  - This feature is so that if you choose to encrypt your data and then
    hide it in an image (steganography) if you’re coerced to extract it
    will still looks like random pixel data
  - Will keep going even if decryption cannot be verified (until an out
    of memory error - or similar - occurs!)
* Random IV’s (not derived from key)
* Build Slackware package for easy installation
* On Android, display notification of progress

### Fixed For Next Release

* Figure out why the Android app doesn’t like Windows encrypted files
  - It wasn’t actually due to Windows, but a subtle bug in the Android
    code
* Fix bug caused by no rc file

TODO

### Add From Previous Release

* Find a way to merge file/magic info into main magic.mgc file
* File context menu for
  - Thunar (consider plugin)
  - Nautilus (or Files or whatever it’s called now)
  - Konqueror or Dolphin (maybe - it’s Qt based not GTK)

### Fix From Previous Release

* Fix SIGSEGV if the source file is deleted (even while doing nothing)
  (GTK file selection dialog)

### Add For This Release

* More iterations for key/IV?

### Fix For This Release

* Figure out why occasionally the Windows build crashes - confirmed as
  both an algorithm and Windows 8 issue - attempting to use AES/Rijndael
  causes a major crash - cannot reproduce on Windows 7 (could be
  libgcrypt version or even 32/64-bit related)
