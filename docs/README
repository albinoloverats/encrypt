-----------------

A significant bug in regards to the encryption of directories on Windows
has been fixed with the help of Mark Condic, so much thanks there!

There has also been several significant changes on all platforms such as
the more traditional (or expected) approach to file links:  on Unix-like
systems the links themselves are stored by default (unlike before, where
the files the links pointed to were stored); and on Windows and Android,
obviously they don't have links to encrypt,  but during decryption links
are handled in one of two ways: symbolic links are ignored, whereas hard
links cause the file to be copied. Although this means the file is dupl-
icated it's the closest approximation to the original as possible.

The second major addition to encrypt's abilities is the option to create
encrypted archives for previous versions of the application. NB This has
only had limited testing and shouldn't be relied upon! You should really
be using the latest version wherever possible! (But it's there for those
who might find it useful from time-to-time.)
