encrypt - 2013.02                                 (sometime in) Feb 2013
=================

Hot off the heals of our last release we're here with another. It brings
the much needed and hugely requested new feature: encrypted directories.
You can now select and encrypt directories in addition to files. The has
resulted in an update to the user interface to show the current progress
and overall progress of the encryption/decryption.

The other significant update is for Android version: key file support is
now available. Use the menu to toggle between entering a password or se-
lecting a file to for key generation.

There has also been a couple of changes to the internal structure of the 
encrypted files; though as always, the latest version is able to decrypt
your previously encrypted data.

The native OS X port is now here too! So that's now GNU/Linux, Microsoft
Windows, Android and of course Apple's OS X!
