=================


About
-----

encrypt is a simple, cross platform, file encryption application.  It is
suitable  for any modern  desktop or mobile  operating system.  The GUI,
either GTK or native,  has been designed to be common across systems and
intuitive to use,  while still providing  command-line capabilities  for
power-users.

It is  currently available  as a  binary package  for several  GNU/Linux
distributions:  Arch,  Debian,  Fedora,  Slackware;  as well as FreeBSD,
Solaris, Apple’s OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Android.  It has also been
successfully compiled and shown working on Gentoo and Debian GNU/Hurd.

It supports  a wide range of algorithms  (provided by GNU’s libgcrypt or
gnu-crypto), of which many are common between the two libraries and thus
allow encrypted  files to be  shared between systems.   (Check that your
target system  does support your  intended cipher,  as support will vary
depending on the library available.)

TODO
----

### Add

* Find a way to merge file/magic info into main magic.mgc file
* File context menu for
  - Thunar (consider plugin)
  - Nautilus (or Files or whatever it’s called now)
  - Konqueror or Dolphin (maybe - it’s Qt based not GTK)
