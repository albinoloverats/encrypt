encrypt - 2014.00                                                 ? 2014
====================

Done
----

* Add option to not start up the GUI (needed it so I can encrypt/decrypt
  on the fly with Vim).
* Add ability to choose from various encrypt modes:
  - ECB (Electronic Codebook)
  - CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)
  - CFB (Cipher Feedback)
  - OFB (Output Feedback)
  - CTR (Counter)
* Add Encrypt/Decrypt option to Windows Explorer file context menu
* Fix disappearing keyboard bug on Android
* Choosing an algorithm (GUI/Android) will leave it as the default for
  next time
* Store rc file in user home (Windows)
* Fix some memory leaks
* Fix SIGSEGV when there is no config file
* Fix dependency on Homebrew (I think I've got this covered)
* Use GTK+3 on Windows
* Fix Windows decrypt issue
* Use latest version of libgcrypt on Windows
* Investigate why the CTR cipher differs between libgcrypt and GNUCrypto
  - Correctly set counter on desktop

TODO
----

* Fix SIGSEGV if the source file is deleted (even while doing nothing)
* Investigate why the CTR cipher differs between libgcrypt and GNUCrypto
  - Find a way to get version 2.1.0 of GNUCrypto working on Android
* Find a way to merge file/magic info into main magic.mgc file
* File context menu for
  - Thunar (consider plugin)
  - Nautilus (or Files or whatever it's called now)
  - Konqueror or Dolphin (maybe - KDE is Qt, not GTK)
