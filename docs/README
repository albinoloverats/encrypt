=================


About
-----

encrypt is a simple, cross platform, file encryption application. It is
suitable for any modern desktop or mobile operating system. The GUI,
either GTK or native, has been designed to be common across systems and
intuitive to use, while still providing command-line capabilities for
power-users.

It is currently available as a binary package for several GNU/Linux
distributions: Arch, Debian, Fedora, Slackware; as well as FreeBSD and
Apple’s OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Android.

It supports a wide range of algorithms (provided by GNU’s libcrypt or
gnu-crypto), of which many are common between the two libraries and thus
allow encrypted files to be shared between systems. (Check that your
target system does support your intended cipher, as support will vary
depending on the library available.)

TODO
----

### Add

* Find a way of signing OS X application so that com.apple.quarantine
  doesn't cause problems; currently this requires

    xattr -cr Encrypt.app

  after extracting the App from the disk image.

* Find a way to merge file/magic info into main magic.mgc file
* File context menu for
  - Thunar (consider plugin)
  - Nautilus (or Files or whatever it’s called now)
  - Konqueror or Dolphin (maybe - it’s Qt based not GTK)
