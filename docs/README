encrypt - 2013.02                                 (sometime in) Feb 2013
=================

Hot off the heals of our last release, we've another. This brings a well
needed, and requested, feature addition:  recursive encryption.  You can
now select and encrypt directories as well as files. The has resulted in
an update/enhancement of the user interface to show the current progress
and overall progress of the encryption/decryption.

The native OS X port is still (slowly) being worked on; everything still
works, and it is compatible with all the other versions of encrypt. Alas
we're still having some issues packaging it up for easy distribution and
installation.
