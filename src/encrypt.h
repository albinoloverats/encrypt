 * The main encryption routine; the only visible function is for the

 * \brief         Create a new encryption instance
 * \param[in]  i  The source to encrypt
 * \param[in]  o  The output after encryption
 * \param[in]  c  The name of the cipher
 * \param[in]  h  The name of the hash
 * \param[in]  m  The name of the mode
 * \param[in]  k  Key data
 * \param[in]  l  Size of key data
 * \param[in]  n  Raw - don't write a header or any verification
 * \param[in]  x  Compress data before encryption
 * \param[in]  f  Follow symlinks
 * \param[in]  v  Backwards compatibility version
 * \return        A new encryption instance
 *
 * Create a new encryption instance, which if the status is INIT, is
 * ready to be executed. Any other status is a failure. If the input and
 * output file names are NULL, stdin/stdout will be used instead.
