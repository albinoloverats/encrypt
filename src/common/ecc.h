/*
 * Basic Software Tool for Encoding and Decoding Files.
 *
 * This is a simple stream encoder which uses the rslib routines to
 * do something practical. It reads data from stdin in 248(encode) or
 * 256(decode) blocks, and writes the corresponding encoded/decoded
 * block onto stdout. An encoded block contains 248 data bytes, one
 * length byte, six redundancy bytes, and a capital G byte as a sync
 * marker to round it out to 256 bytes.
