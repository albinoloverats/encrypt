 * Basic Software Tool for Encoding and Decoding Files.
 *
 * This is a simple stream encoder. It takes a buffer of data 249 bytes
 * (encode) - or 255 bytes (decode) - and copies the corresponding
 * encoded/decoded block to the output buffer. An encoded block contains
 * 249 data bytes and 6 redundancy bytes.
